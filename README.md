# PyCoreExp

Welcome to PyCoreExp! This repository serves as an experimental playground where I'm embarking on a journey to reimagine fundamental built-in functions in Python. Join me in this coding experiment to gain insights into Python's core mechanics.

# Getting Started

Clone: git clone https://github.com/BennoCrafter/PyCoreExp
Explore: Check out the functions/ directory to witness my experiments in recreating core functions.
Experiment: Feel free to try out my functions in practical scenarios using the examples in the examples/ directory.

Embark on this coding experiment with me through PyCoreExp. Let's explore Python's core together! 🧪🚀🐍
